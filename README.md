Developed for the Test Theory course at Tilburg University.

### Usage

To run the application locally:

```r
# Load library.
library(shiny)

# Run app.
runApp(".")
```

Note. If your application lives in a different folder (i.e., not the current working directory) you need to specify the path to that folder, e.g., `var/www/my-app`. Alternatively, you can set the working directory to that path and use `runApp(".")`.
